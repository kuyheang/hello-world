# hello-world
This is my first repository.

Hi, I'm Kuyheang. The easy pronunciation for my name is, Koi-Hang. If that's still too difficult to pronounce, I let people use my nickname, Koi.
I'm a UI/UX designer and I have a passion for helping people. My work is driven by spending time thinking of the people who will use a product. What is important to them? What challenges do they face? How can we make their day better?
